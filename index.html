	<h2> All About Me!!</h2>
	<p class="p1" style= "background-color:honeydew"> Hi everyone! My name is Vabryelle Torres. I am 21 years old, and I'm currently attending college at NVC for 3D animation and Graphic Design! My favorite hobbys include: gaming, watching anime, and scrolling through tiktok! </p>
	<h3> My love for Anime! </h3>
	<img src="images/anime_landscape_small.jpg" alt = "anime landscape">
	<p class="p2" style="background-color:darkseagreen">  I just recently joined the anime fandom a year ago, but I have become an avid watcher. The first anime I watched is a common one called <i>"Naruto."</i> Ever since I finished it I would say that I have finished about 150 different other animes. My all time favorites at the moment are Jujutsu Kaisen, <a href="https://attackontitan.fandom.com/wiki/Attack_on_Titan_Wiki"> Attack On Titan,</a> and Demon Slayer. My favorite genre right now is action that includes a little romance. I like the feeling of fantasy that anime gives off. <b>It really is indescribable!</b> </p>
	<h4> I am also trying to start a small business!</h4>

	<p class="p3" style="background-color:cadetblue"> The above image is an art piece I did for a friend! I am excited to start this becasue this is where I will incorporate both anime and my art into my business! I am fairly new to digital art but I think I will pick it up in no time! I'm really excited to see how far this can take me!</p>
